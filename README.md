# mucus halo of marine_snow
This code evaluates the hydrodynamic radius (no-flow region) around marine snow through PIV of marine snow and generates a PIV with particle statistics

The partice shape, size and flow measure resulting from this analysis is explained in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.01982

This analysis follows the PIV analysis given in the other repository
