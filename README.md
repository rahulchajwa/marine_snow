# mucus halo of marine snow
This analysis follows the PIV analysis given in the other repository. This code evaluates the hydrodynamic radius (no-flow region) around marine snow through PIV of marine snow (as seen below)

The red dotted ellipse is fitted around region of zero velocity using thresholding the vertical velocity profile. 

The code further yields both PIV image, with visible particle and particle and flow characteristics.

The partice shape, size and flow measure resulting from this analysis is explained in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.01982
